## Welcome to the OWASP Cluj-Napoca Chapter Homepage

## About

Cluj-Napoca has a large and strong software development presence. Since application security is a vital aspect of software engineering,
we've created a community where people interested in information security can meet, learn and share ideas, through our meetings and by also connecting online.


## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve software security.
All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in application security.
This chapter is led by local [leaders](leaders.md) in accordance with the [OWASP Chapter Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/chapters).

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our Projects, Events, [Chapter meetings](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-cluj-napoca-chapter),
[Mail Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com), and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com), no matter their skill level or experience.
[OWASP membership](https://owasp.org/membership) is NOT a requirement.

OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert.
We also encourage you to be become a [member](https://owasp.org/membership) or consider a [donation](https://owasp.org/donate) to support our ongoing work.
